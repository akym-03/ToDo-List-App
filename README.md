# ToDo-List-App
Activity (React)
So this file contains a ToDo List App Code. I also used bootstrap for basic styling and FontAwesome icons. In this file you will be able to view the source code of the ToDo List App. In running this program the user will be able to add new task, mark your task as completed, delete task, and update/edit your task. So the requirements needed to successfully run this code is to install NodeJS in your PC and a terminal program (command prompt/power shell)
