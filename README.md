# ToDo-List-App
Activity (React)

This is a simple To Do List App using ReactJS. I used bootstrap for basic styling and FontAwesome icons in creating this project. USing this React JS App we will be abble to: Add new task, Mark task as done, Delete task, and Update/Edit task. Some requirements are needed to be able to run the program successfully, like installing NodeJS in your PC and Terminal program (command prompt/power shell).
